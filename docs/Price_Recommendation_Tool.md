An exploratory data analysis was conducted using `ydata-profiling` to generate insights about the distribution of the extracted dataset. The analysis focused on the flat rent data set, and the results can be accessed [here](https://michaelseitz98.github.io/enterprise-ai-project/eda-wue-rent-all.html).

The purpose of the exploratory data analysis was to gain an overview of the variables, identify missing values, assess class imbalance, and explore correlations among different variables. Statistical measures and visualizations were employed to understand the dataset's structure, uncover patterns, and identify potential issues. The analysis serves as a crucial step in the data exploration process, providing a foundation for informed decisions related to feature engineering and modeling.
