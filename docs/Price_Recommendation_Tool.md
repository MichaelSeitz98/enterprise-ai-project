To generate insights about the distribution of the extracted dataset, an exploratory data analysis was conducted using `ydata profiling`. 

The results of the flat rent data set can be found [here](https://michaelseitz98.github.io/enterprise-ai-project/eda-wue-rent-all.html).

The exploratory data analysis involved utilizing statistical measures and visualizations to examine the dataset, aiding in understanding its structure, identifying patterns, and detecting potential issues. The analysis serves as a foundation for making informed decisions regarding feature engineering and modeling.
