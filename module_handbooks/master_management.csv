sheet theories, typical issues concerning cost and managerial accounting as well as financial accounting and pu-
blicity are discussed.","Initially, a fundamental knowledge about the conception and impact of management and financial accounting 
as information systems is acquired. In the following, the module mainly sharpens the understanding of the eco-

Contract Theory,12-M-EG1-182-m01,"Holder of the Chair of Contract Theory and Information Eco-
nomics",Faculty of Business Management and Economics,5,numerical grade,,,,,"During the 1960/70s, microeconomic theory came to acknowledge that many (if not most) economic transacti-
ons are characterized by asymmetric distribution of information – i.e., at least one of the parties participating in 
a transaction usually is privy to information that the remaining parties do not have access to. This asymmetric 
distribution of information subsequently was recognized to be a major impediment for transactions to be eco-
nomically efficient. Contract theory addresses the question how the inefficiencies arising from asymmetric dis-
tribution of information can best be mitigated by appropriate design of the contractual (or, more generally, insti-
tutional) framework that governs the transaction under consideration. This lecture covers the baseline models 
of “moral hazard” (i.e., situations where one party has private knowledge after a contract has been signed) and 
“adverse selection” (i.e., situations where one party has private knowledge before a contract is signed). As appli-
cations we will address questions discussed in organizational, personnel or industrial economics, such as incen-
tive design within organizations or the design of labor law regulations and competition laws.
Even though we will work with precise mathematical formalizations of the ideas that we want to think and talk 
about, this course requires little more than a solid understanding of basic differential calculus. More important 
than having a solid mathematical background is having a strong interest in formal economic analysis and fun 
with logical thinking and puzzle solving.
The exposition is primarily based on the following textbook:
• Laffont and Martimort (2002): ""The Theory of Incentives""","After completing the course students will be able to
• explain essential findings of contract theory,
• apply the involved methods to given stylized examples on their own,
• interpret the properties of real-life contracts as the outcome of the interaction between two or more con-
tracting parties in the presence of asymmetric information,
• evaluate government interventions with regard to their effect on the efficiency properties of the interaction 
between the contracting parties.",V (2) + Ü (2),,--,,150 h,--,--,"Master's degree (1 major) Management (2018), Master's degree (1 major) International Economic Policy (2018), Master's degree (1 major) China Business and Economics (2019), Master's degree (1 major) China Language and Economy (2019), Master's degree (1 major) China Business and Economics (2021), Master's degree (1 major) China Language and Economy (2021), Master's degree (1 major) Economathematics (2021), exchange program Business Management and Economics (2022), , Management, , , data record Master (120 ECTS) Management - 2018, , , Management","--

are formulated. In a second step, we focus on the firm sector and address how firms solve for optimal production 
plans. In a third step, we explain what role the central bank plays in stabilising the business cycle. Thereby, we 
show how changes in interest rates interact with optimal decisions taken by households and firms.
We also discuss hot topics such as CAPM models and monetary policy in the euro area.","The course offers analytical tools designed to solve DSGE models. These analytical skills encompas:
• Solving of intertemporal optimization problems (e.g., consumption Euler-equations).
• Linearization methods (e.g., Taylor-expansions).
• Solving linear difference expectations by minimum state variabel techniques (MSV-solution).
• Basic time series concepts such as impilse response functions, variance decompositions.

Students gain solid basic knowledge of employment and labour law, the works council and its tasks and an over-
view of collective agreement law. At the same time, methodically and substantively sound legal knowledge is 
conveyed and practical relevance is established with case studies and current case law.
By working on an exam in the form of a legal opinion, the students are taught to solve a demanding legal issue 
with legal problems in a given time. Within a narrow thematic field and a time-limited framework, they are able to 
work on a legal issue in a well-founded and largely independent manner.
Within the framework of the term paper on a judgement of the Federal Labour Court, the students deal with a 
concrete case and the case law of the highest German labour court. They are familiarised with the methods of le-
gal work and are enabled to work independently in a problem-solving manner. In addition to understanding the 
facts of the case and the legal problems, they will focus primarily on the consequences of the judgement for their 
practice. Here, the legal knowledge imparted will be implemented with a practical approach and the opportunity 
to creatively develop their own recommendations on how to deal with the judgement. In addition, the students 
present the case and their own conclusions for practice. In the group discussion, the other students have the op-
portunity to gather further knowledge and actively participate in the exchange of opinions on current judgements 
and case law.

Behavioral Economics,12-M-CIU-182-m01,"Holder of the Chair of Contract Theory and Information Eco-
nomics",Faculty of Business Management and Economics,5,numerical grade,,,,,"Behavioral economics refers to the field of research which, inspired by numerous documented deviations from 
the rational behavior assumed in neoclassical analysis, tries to improve the psychological realism of the idea 
of man in economics by incorporating insights from psychology into traditional economic analysis. In this cour-
se students will become familiar with several of the most influential behavioral-economic theories of individu-
al decision making, which allows to explain a plethora of empirically documented deviations from the neoclassi-
cal model. These behavioral-economic theories usually contain the neoclassical standard model as special case 
and therefore are to be considered as an extensions of rather than alternatives to the neoclassical model. Whi-
le the focus of this lecture is on theories of individual decision making, we will explore the implications of these 
theories also in the context of market settings.
As behavioral economics represents an extension of the neoclassical model, a solid understanding of the latter 
is required for this course. In consequence, the course is intended in particular for advanced students who com-
pleted the class “Advanced Microeconomics”.
While the exposition is primarily based on research articles, some topics of the lecture can be reviewed in the 
following textbooks:

Advanced Microeconomics,12-M-CT-182-m01,"Holder of the Chair of Contract Theory and Information Eco-
nomics",Faculty of Business Management and Economics,5,numerical grade,,,,,"In a nutshell, microeconomic theory considers the behavior of individual economic agents and builds from this 
foundation to a theory of aggregate economic outcomes, which then can be applied for conducting welfare ana-
lysis and giving policy advice. This lecture addresses the core building block of this thought complex: individu-
al decision making and behavior. Specifically, students will come to understand in detail the standard models of 
riskless consumer choice, choice under risk and intertemporal choice and learn about the empirical challenges 
and limitations of these models.
Throughout the lecture, we will work with precise mathematical formalizations of the ideas that we want to think 
and talk about. In consequence, a solid understanding of the mathematical toolbox of standard microeconomics 
(e.g., differential calculus and constrained optimization; basic set theory; integration by parts) will be helpful as 
it will allow to focus on the underlying economic intuition. However, every required mathematical concept will be 
introduced and explained along the way, such that a strong interest in formal economic analysis is more import-
ant than an advanced mathematical background.
The exposition is primarily based on the standard graduate textbooks
• Mas-Colell, Whinston and Green (1995): “Microeconomic Theory”
• Jehle and Reny (2001): “Advanced Microeconomic Theory”","After completing the course students will be able to

a transaction usually is privy to information that the remaining parties do not have access to. This asymmetric 
distribution of information subsequently was recognized to be a major impediment for transactions to be eco-
nomically efficient. Contract theory addresses the question how the inefficiencies arising from asymmetric dis-
tribution of information can best be mitigated by appropriate design of the contractual (or, more generally, insti-
tutional) framework that governs the transaction under consideration. This lecture covers the baseline models 
of “moral hazard” (i.e., situations where one party has private knowledge after a contract has been signed) and 
“adverse selection” (i.e., situations where one party has private knowledge before a contract is signed). As appli-
cations we will address questions discussed in organizational, personnel or industrial economics, such as incen-
tive design within organizations or the design of labor law regulations and competition laws.
Even though we will work with precise mathematical formalizations of the ideas that we want to think and talk 
about, this course requires little more than a solid understanding of basic differential calculus. More important 
than having a solid mathematical background is having a strong interest in formal economic analysis and fun 
with logical thinking and puzzle solving.
The exposition is primarily based on the following textbook:
• Laffont and Martimort (2002): ""The Theory of Incentives""","After completing the course students will be able to
• explain essential findings of contract theory,
• apply the involved methods to given stylized examples on their own,
• interpret the properties of real-life contracts as the outcome of the interaction between two or more con-
tracting parties in the presence of asymmetric information,
• evaluate government interventions with regard to their effect on the efficiency properties of the interaction 
between the contracting parties.",V (2) + Ü (2),,--,,150 h,--,--,"Master's degree (1 major) Management (2018), Master's degree (1 major) International Economic Policy (2018), Master's degree (1 major) China Business and Economics (2019), Master's degree (1 major) China Language and Economy (2019), Master's degree (1 major) China Business and Economics (2021), Master's degree (1 major) China Language and Economy (2021), Master's degree (1 major) Economathematics (2021), exchange program Business Management and Economics (2022), , Management, , , data record Master (120 ECTS) Management - 2018, , , Management","--

Analysis of Financial Market Data,12-M-REKA-182-m01,Holder of the Chair of Econometrics,Faculty of Business Management and Economics,5,numerical grade,,,,,"Description:
The module covers the fundamentals, methods and concepts for the empirical analysis of financial market da-
ta. The concept of market efficiency is explained and critically examined with reference to the random walk hy-
pothesis. To test this hypothesis, a number of parametric and non-parametric methods are proposed and app-
lied in practice. Based on the findings, market microstructure models that can explain some important empiri-
cal findings will be discussed. In addition, the course describes event studies for testing the significant impact of 
corporate news on the share price and discusses issues of univariate time series analysis such as AR(I)MA and 
ARCH / GARCH models that are indispensable for modelling financial market data. In the final part of the course, 
CAPM is discussed and examined, in particular with regard to its empirical applicability.
Syllabus:
1. Information efficiency
2. Random walk
3. Theoretical market models
4. Event studies
5. Univariate modelling of time series data
6. Models to explain volatility (ARCH and GARCH)

nomics",Faculty of Business Management and Economics,5,numerical grade,,,,,"During the 1960/70s, microeconomic theory came to acknowledge that many (if not most) economic transacti-
ons are characterized by asymmetric distribution of information – i.e., at least one of the parties participating in 
a transaction usually is privy to information that the remaining parties do not have access to. This asymmetric 
distribution of information subsequently was recognized to be a major impediment for transactions to be eco-
nomically efficient. Contract theory addresses the question how the inefficiencies arising from asymmetric dis-
tribution of information can best be mitigated by appropriate design of the contractual (or, more generally, insti-
tutional) framework that governs the transaction under consideration. This lecture covers the baseline models 
of “moral hazard” (i.e., situations where one party has private knowledge after a contract has been signed) and 
“adverse selection” (i.e., situations where one party has private knowledge before a contract is signed). As appli-
cations we will address questions discussed in organizational, personnel or industrial economics, such as incen-
tive design within organizations or the design of labor law regulations and competition laws.
Even though we will work with precise mathematical formalizations of the ideas that we want to think and talk 
about, this course requires little more than a solid understanding of basic differential calculus. More important 
than having a solid mathematical background is having a strong interest in formal economic analysis and fun 
with logical thinking and puzzle solving.
The exposition is primarily based on the following textbook:
• Laffont and Martimort (2002): ""The Theory of Incentives""","After completing the course students will be able to
• explain essential findings of contract theory,
• apply the involved methods to given stylized examples on their own,
• interpret the properties of real-life contracts as the outcome of the interaction between two or more con-
tracting parties in the presence of asymmetric information,
• evaluate government interventions with regard to their effect on the efficiency properties of the interaction 
between the contracting parties.",V (2) + Ü (2),,--,,150 h,--,--,"Master's degree (1 major) Management (2018), Master's degree (1 major) International Economic Policy (2018), Master's degree (1 major) China Business and Economics (2019), Master's degree (1 major) China Language and Economy (2019), Master's degree (1 major) China Business and Economics (2021), Master's degree (1 major) China Language and Economy (2021), Master's degree (1 major) Economathematics (2021), exchange program Business Management and Economics (2022), , Management, , , data record Master (120 ECTS) Management - 2018, , , Management","--

Students gain solid basic knowledge of employment and labour law, the works council and its tasks and an over-
view of collective agreement law. At the same time, methodically and substantively sound legal knowledge is 
conveyed and practical relevance is established with case studies and current case law.
By working on an exam in the form of a legal opinion, the students are taught to solve a demanding legal issue 
with legal problems in a given time. Within a narrow thematic field and a time-limited framework, they are able to 
work on a legal issue in a well-founded and largely independent manner.
Within the framework of the term paper on a judgement of the Federal Labour Court, the students deal with a 
concrete case and the case law of the highest German labour court. They are familiarised with the methods of le-
gal work and are enabled to work independently in a problem-solving manner. In addition to understanding the 
facts of the case and the legal problems, they will focus primarily on the consequences of the judgement for their 
practice. Here, the legal knowledge imparted will be implemented with a practical approach and the opportunity 
to creatively develop their own recommendations on how to deal with the judgement. In addition, the students 
present the case and their own conclusions for practice. In the group discussion, the other students have the op-
portunity to gather further knowledge and actively participate in the exchange of opinions on current judgements 
and case law.
The knowledge imparted is relevant for a wide range of professional fields of activity and is especially valuable 
for students who will work in the field of human resources or are interested in the field of employee manage-
ment.",S (2),,"30 places. (1) Should the number of applications exceed the number of available places, places will be allocated

are designed to describe the business cycle at the macro level. In a first step, we analyse the behaviour of a re-
presentative household. In particular, we describe how consumption, asset allocation and labour supply plans 
are formulated. In a second step, we focus on the firm sector and address how firms solve for optimal production 
plans. In a third step, we explain what role the central bank plays in stabilising the business cycle. Thereby, we 
show how changes in interest rates interact with optimal decisions taken by households and firms.
We also discuss hot topics such as CAPM models and monetary policy in the euro area.","The course offers analytical tools designed to solve DSGE models. These analytical skills encompas:
• Solving of intertemporal optimization problems (e.g., consumption Euler-equations).
• Linearization methods (e.g., Taylor-expansions).
• Solving linear difference expectations by minimum state variabel techniques (MSV-solution).
• Basic time series concepts such as impilse response functions, variance decompositions.

Advanced Microeconomics,12-M-OE3-182-m01,"Holder of the Chair of Contract Theory and Information Eco-
nomics",Faculty of Business Management and Economics,5,numerical grade,,,,,"In a nutshell, microeconomic theory considers the behavior of individual economic agents and builds from this 
foundation to a theory of aggregate economic outcomes, which then can be applied for conducting welfare ana-
lysis and giving policy advice. This lecture addresses the core building block of this thought complex: individu-
al decision making and behavior. Specifically, students will come to understand in detail the standard models of 
riskless consumer choice, choice under risk and intertemporal choice and learn about the empirical challenges 
and limitations of these models.
Throughout the lecture, we will work with precise mathematical formalizations of the ideas that we want to think 
and talk about. In consequence, a solid understanding of the mathematical toolbox of standard microeconomics 
(e.g., differential calculus and constrained optimization; basic set theory; integration by parts) will be helpful as 
it will allow to focus on the underlying economic intuition. However, every required mathematical concept will be 
introduced and explained along the way, such that a strong interest in formal economic analysis is more import-
ant than an advanced mathematical background.
The exposition is primarily based on the standard graduate textbooks
• Mas-Colell, Whinston and Green (1995): “Microeconomic Theory”
• Jehle and Reny (2001): “Advanced Microeconomic Theory”","After completing the course students will be able to

Policy Evaluation Methods,12-M-DFES-182-m01,Holder of the Chair of Labor Economics,Faculty of Business Management and Economics,5,numerical grade,,,,,"This course offers an introduction to the fundamentals of causal inference and to widely used research desi-
gns in the social sciences. In the first part a framework for understanding causality is introduced. Specifically, 
the epistemological differences between association, intervention and counterfactuals are explained. Then it is 
shown why experiments are paramount in generating causal knowledge and which assumptions are needed for 
which level of the causal hierarchy. Finally, we will discuss two widely used approaches to causality in the social 
sciences, i.e. potential outcomes and directed acyclic graphs.
The second part is devoted to the research designs regressions analysis, difference-in-differences, instrumen-
tal variables, and regression discontinuity. The emphasis is how these research designs are for example applied 
to answer important questions in labour economics such as the effects of a minimum wage increase on employ-
ment or the effect of children on female labour supply and wages.
The assumptions each research design requires in order to identify a causal effect will be at center stage of the 
lecture. Therefore the emphasis is to teach students what one needs to estimate in order to answer a given que-
stion. Further, the research designs are discussed such that students will be able to evaluate and apply these re-
search designs to other questions and fields.","At the end of the course, students should be able to understand basic concepts and methods of causal infe-
rence, as well as read, interpret, and assess the credibility of scientific publications. In addition, the course ser-

Experimental Economics,12-M-OE1-182-m01,Holder of the Chair of Labor Economics,Faculty of Business Management and Economics,5,numerical grade,,,,,"Aim and outline of the course:
The Nobel Prizes for Daniel Kahneman and Vernon Smith 2002 and for Richard Thaler 2017 have underlined the 
increasing importance of experimental methods in economics. Experimental methods are used to collect data 
using randomization or a highly controlled environment. This course offers an introduction to the methodology of 
experimental economics and economic laboratory experiments.
In the methodology part it is shown why experiments are a good tool to generate scientific knowledge. Further-
more, widely used techniques in economic experiments are explained and how economic experiments differ 
from experiments in other social sciences. This part also deals with methods of reasoning, i.e. how inferences 
can be drawn from evidence that is generated by experiments.
The unifying theme of all laboratory experiments that will be covered is, understanding the behavior of agents, 
who produce and/or distribute goods by interacting with each other. The first topic is about markets and it in-
cludes experiments that shown under which conditions and institutions markets work very efficient and under 
which conditions and institutions they fail to yield a desirable outcome. The second topic includes experiments 
that look at the behavior of two agents, who bargain about the distribution of a common pie. On the basis of the-
se results we will discuss experiments that try to explain bargaining behavior and show how agents deviate sy-
stematically from the neoclassical framework, i.e. the “homo oeconomicus”. The third topic deals with coopera-
tion and institutions that support cooperation in the long run as equilibrium. Further, systematic evidence will be 
presented on how individuals can be classified in different cooperative types and how these types can explain 
economic outcomes in natural environments. The forth topic concerns reciprocity, a strong determining factor of 
human behavior that is nearly universal. We will cover experiments that show how reciprocity can enforce relatio-
nal contracts in the absence of third party enforcement. Moreover, there will be a special emphasis on how reci-
procity affects labor markets.
When time permits up to two additional topics will be covered. The first topic is about gender differences in com-
petitiveness, risk-aversion and overconfidence. The second topic is about the elicitation of social norms.
Prerequisites: Participants should have a basic knowledge about microeconomics, game theory and econome-
trics.

The course will be mainly paper based but the following books provide a good overview and complement the dis-
cussed papers.

In addition lecture slides will be provided.
Grading: Grading will be based on a presentation and a term paper.

Policy Evaluation Methods,12-M-IB-161-m01,Holder of the Chair of Labor Economics,Faculty of Business Management and Economics,5,numerical grade,,,,,"This course offers an introduction to the fundamentals of causal inference and to widely used research desi-
gns in the social sciences. In the first part a framework for understanding causality is introduced. Specifically, 
the epistemological differences between association, intervention and counterfactuals are explained. Then it is 
shown why experiments are paramount in generating causal knowledge and which assumptions are needed for 
which level of the causal hierarchy. Finally, we will discuss two widely used approaches to causality in the social 
sciences, i.e. potential outcomes and directed acyclic graphs.
The second part is devoted to the research designs regressions analysis, difference-in-differences, instrumen-
tal variables, and regression discontinuity. The emphasis is how these research designs are for example applied 
to answer important questions in labour economics such as the effects of a minimum wage increase on employ-
ment or the effect of children on female labour supply and wages.
The assumptions each research design requires in order to identify a causal effect will be at center stage of the 
lecture. Therefore the emphasis is to teach students what one needs to estimate in order to answer a given que-
stion. Further, the research designs are discussed such that students will be able to evaluate and apply these re-
search designs to other questions and fields.","At the end of the course, students should be able to understand basic concepts and methods of causal infe-
rence, as well as read, interpret, and assess the credibility of scientific publications. In addition, the course ser-

Advanced Microeconomics,12-M-CT-182-m01,"Holder of the Chair of Contract Theory and Information Eco-
nomics",Faculty of Business Management and Economics,5,numerical grade,,,,,"In a nutshell, microeconomic theory considers the behavior of individual economic agents and builds from this 
foundation to a theory of aggregate economic outcomes, which then can be applied for conducting welfare ana-
lysis and giving policy advice. This lecture addresses the core building block of this thought complex: individu-
al decision making and behavior. Specifically, students will come to understand in detail the standard models of 
riskless consumer choice, choice under risk and intertemporal choice and learn about the empirical challenges 
and limitations of these models.
Throughout the lecture, we will work with precise mathematical formalizations of the ideas that we want to think 
and talk about. In consequence, a solid understanding of the mathematical toolbox of standard microeconomics 
(e.g., differential calculus and constrained optimization; basic set theory; integration by parts) will be helpful as 
it will allow to focus on the underlying economic intuition. However, every required mathematical concept will be 
introduced and explained along the way, such that a strong interest in formal economic analysis is more import-
ant than an advanced mathematical background.
The exposition is primarily based on the standard graduate textbooks
• Mas-Colell, Whinston and Green (1995): “Microeconomic Theory”
• Jehle and Reny (2001): “Advanced Microeconomic Theory”","After completing the course students will be able to

Contract Theory,12-M-SDC-182-m01,"Holder of the Chair of Contract Theory and Information Eco-
nomics",Faculty of Business Management and Economics,5,numerical grade,,,,,"During the 1960/70s, microeconomic theory came to acknowledge that many (if not most) economic transacti-
ons are characterized by asymmetric distribution of information – i.e., at least one of the parties participating in 
a transaction usually is privy to information that the remaining parties do not have access to. This asymmetric 
distribution of information subsequently was recognized to be a major impediment for transactions to be eco-
nomically efficient. Contract theory addresses the question how the inefficiencies arising from asymmetric dis-
tribution of information can best be mitigated by appropriate design of the contractual (or, more generally, insti-
tutional) framework that governs the transaction under consideration. This lecture covers the baseline models 
of “moral hazard” (i.e., situations where one party has private knowledge after a contract has been signed) and 
“adverse selection” (i.e., situations where one party has private knowledge before a contract is signed). As appli-
cations we will address questions discussed in organizational, personnel or industrial economics, such as incen-
tive design within organizations or the design of labor law regulations and competition laws.
Even though we will work with precise mathematical formalizations of the ideas that we want to think and talk 
about, this course requires little more than a solid understanding of basic differential calculus. More important 
than having a solid mathematical background is having a strong interest in formal economic analysis and fun 
with logical thinking and puzzle solving.

• Laffont and Martimort (2002): ""The Theory of Incentives""","After completing the course students will be able to
• explain essential findings of contract theory,
• apply the involved methods to given stylized examples on their own,
• interpret the properties of real-life contracts as the outcome of the interaction between two or more con-

Behavioral Economics,12-M-AO-182-m01,"Holder of the Chair of Contract Theory and Information Eco-

the rational behavior assumed in neoclassical analysis, tries to improve the psychological realism of the idea 
of man in economics by incorporating insights from psychology into traditional economic analysis. In this cour-
se students will become familiar with several of the most influential behavioral-economic theories of individu-
al decision making, which allows to explain a plethora of empirically documented deviations from the neoclassi-
cal model. These behavioral-economic theories usually contain the neoclassical standard model as special case 
and therefore are to be considered as an extensions of rather than alternatives to the neoclassical model. Whi-
le the focus of this lecture is on theories of individual decision making, we will explore the implications of these 
theories also in the context of market settings.

is required for this course. In consequence, the course is intended in particular for advanced students who com-

are designed to describe the business cycle at the macro level. In a first step, we analyse the behaviour of a re-
presentative household. In particular, we describe how consumption, asset allocation and labour supply plans 
are formulated. In a second step, we focus on the firm sector and address how firms solve for optimal production 
plans. In a third step, we explain what role the central bank plays in stabilising the business cycle. Thereby, we 
show how changes in interest rates interact with optimal decisions taken by households and firms.
We also discuss hot topics such as CAPM models and monetary policy in the euro area.","The course offers analytical tools designed to solve DSGE models. These analytical skills encompas:
• Solving of intertemporal optimization problems (e.g., consumption Euler-equations).
• Linearization methods (e.g., Taylor-expansions).
• Solving linear difference expectations by minimum state variabel techniques (MSV-solution).
• Basic time series concepts such as impilse response functions, variance decompositions.
• Basic insights in MATLAB/ Dynare programming: specifying, solving and estimating DSGE models.

gns in the social sciences. In the first part a framework for understanding causality is introduced. Specifically, 
the epistemological differences between association, intervention and counterfactuals are explained. Then it is 
shown why experiments are paramount in generating causal knowledge and which assumptions are needed for 
which level of the causal hierarchy. Finally, we will discuss two widely used approaches to causality in the social 
sciences, i.e. potential outcomes and directed acyclic graphs.
The second part is devoted to the research designs regressions analysis, difference-in-differences, instrumen-
tal variables, and regression discontinuity. The emphasis is how these research designs are for example applied 
to answer important questions in labour economics such as the effects of a minimum wage increase on employ-
ment or the effect of children on female labour supply and wages.
The assumptions each research design requires in order to identify a causal effect will be at center stage of the 
lecture. Therefore the emphasis is to teach students what one needs to estimate in order to answer a given que-
stion. Further, the research designs are discussed such that students will be able to evaluate and apply these re-
search designs to other questions and fields.","At the end of the course, students should be able to understand basic concepts and methods of causal infe-

Experimental Economics,12-M-PSE-182-m01,Holder of the Chair of Labor Economics,Faculty of Business Management and Economics,5,numerical grade,,,,,"Aim and outline of the course:
The Nobel Prizes for Daniel Kahneman and Vernon Smith 2002 and for Richard Thaler 2017 have underlined the 
increasing importance of experimental methods in economics. Experimental methods are used to collect data 
using randomization or a highly controlled environment. This course offers an introduction to the methodology of 
experimental economics and economic laboratory experiments.
In the methodology part it is shown why experiments are a good tool to generate scientific knowledge. Further-
more, widely used techniques in economic experiments are explained and how economic experiments differ 
from experiments in other social sciences. This part also deals with methods of reasoning, i.e. how inferences 
can be drawn from evidence that is generated by experiments.
The unifying theme of all laboratory experiments that will be covered is, understanding the behavior of agents, 
who produce and/or distribute goods by interacting with each other. The first topic is about markets and it in-
cludes experiments that shown under which conditions and institutions markets work very efficient and under 
which conditions and institutions they fail to yield a desirable outcome. The second topic includes experiments 
that look at the behavior of two agents, who bargain about the distribution of a common pie. On the basis of the-
se results we will discuss experiments that try to explain bargaining behavior and show how agents deviate sy-
stematically from the neoclassical framework, i.e. the “homo oeconomicus”. The third topic deals with coopera-
tion and institutions that support cooperation in the long run as equilibrium. Further, systematic evidence will be 
presented on how individuals can be classified in different cooperative types and how these types can explain 
economic outcomes in natural environments. The forth topic concerns reciprocity, a strong determining factor of 
human behavior that is nearly universal. We will cover experiments that show how reciprocity can enforce relatio-
nal contracts in the absence of third party enforcement. Moreover, there will be a special emphasis on how reci-
procity affects labor markets.
When time permits up to two additional topics will be covered. The first topic is about gender differences in com-
petitiveness, risk-aversion and overconfidence. The second topic is about the elicitation of social norms.
Prerequisites: Participants should have a basic knowledge about microeconomics, game theory and econome-
trics.

The course will be mainly paper based but the following books provide a good overview and complement the dis-
cussed papers.

The module covers the fundamentals, methods and concepts for the empirical analysis of financial market da-
ta. The concept of market efficiency is explained and critically examined with reference to the random walk hy-
pothesis. To test this hypothesis, a number of parametric and non-parametric methods are proposed and app-
lied in practice. Based on the findings, market microstructure models that can explain some important empiri-
cal findings will be discussed. In addition, the course describes event studies for testing the significant impact of 
corporate news on the share price and discusses issues of univariate time series analysis such as AR(I)MA and 
ARCH / GARCH models that are indispensable for modelling financial market data. In the final part of the course, 
CAPM is discussed and examined, in particular with regard to its empirical applicability.

Advanced Microeconomics,12-M-CT-182-m01,"Holder of the Chair of Contract Theory and Information Eco-

foundation to a theory of aggregate economic outcomes, which then can be applied for conducting welfare ana-
lysis and giving policy advice. This lecture addresses the core building block of this thought complex: individu-
al decision making and behavior. Specifically, students will come to understand in detail the standard models of 
riskless consumer choice, choice under risk and intertemporal choice and learn about the empirical challenges 
and limitations of these models.
Throughout the lecture, we will work with precise mathematical formalizations of the ideas that we want to think 
and talk about. In consequence, a solid understanding of the mathematical toolbox of standard microeconomics 
(e.g., differential calculus and constrained optimization; basic set theory; integration by parts) will be helpful as 
it will allow to focus on the underlying economic intuition. However, every required mathematical concept will be 
introduced and explained along the way, such that a strong interest in formal economic analysis is more import-
ant than an advanced mathematical background.
The exposition is primarily based on the standard graduate textbooks

• Jehle and Reny (2001): “Advanced Microeconomic Theory”","After completing the course students will be able to

Contract Theory,12-M-BEC-182-m01,"Holder of the Chair of Contract Theory and Information Eco-
nomics",Faculty of Business Management and Economics,5,numerical grade,,,,,"During the 1960/70s, microeconomic theory came to acknowledge that many (if not most) economic transacti-
ons are characterized by asymmetric distribution of information – i.e., at least one of the parties participating in 
a transaction usually is privy to information that the remaining parties do not have access to. This asymmetric 
distribution of information subsequently was recognized to be a major impediment for transactions to be eco-
nomically efficient. Contract theory addresses the question how the inefficiencies arising from asymmetric dis-
tribution of information can best be mitigated by appropriate design of the contractual (or, more generally, insti-
tutional) framework that governs the transaction under consideration. This lecture covers the baseline models 
of “moral hazard” (i.e., situations where one party has private knowledge after a contract has been signed) and 
“adverse selection” (i.e., situations where one party has private knowledge before a contract is signed). As appli-
cations we will address questions discussed in organizational, personnel or industrial economics, such as incen-
tive design within organizations or the design of labor law regulations and competition laws.
Even though we will work with precise mathematical formalizations of the ideas that we want to think and talk 
about, this course requires little more than a solid understanding of basic differential calculus. More important 
than having a solid mathematical background is having a strong interest in formal economic analysis and fun 
with logical thinking and puzzle solving.
The exposition is primarily based on the following textbook:
• Laffont and Martimort (2002): ""The Theory of Incentives""","After completing the course students will be able to
• explain essential findings of contract theory,
• apply the involved methods to given stylized examples on their own,
• interpret the properties of real-life contracts as the outcome of the interaction between two or more con-
tracting parties in the presence of asymmetric information,
• evaluate government interventions with regard to their effect on the efficiency properties of the interaction 
between the contracting parties.",V (2) + Ü (2),,--,,150 h,--,--,"Master's degree (1 major) Management (2018), Master's degree (1 major) International Economic Policy (2018), Master's degree (1 major) China Business and Economics (2019), Master's degree (1 major) China Language and Economy (2019), Master's degree (1 major) China Business and Economics (2021), Master's degree (1 major) China Language and Economy (2021), Master's degree (1 major) Economathematics (2021), exchange program Business Management and Economics (2022), , Management, , , data record Master (120 ECTS) Management - 2018, , , Management","--

Behavioral Economics,12-M-TDS-182-m01,"Holder of the Chair of Contract Theory and Information Eco-
nomics",Faculty of Business Management and Economics,5,numerical grade,,,,,"Behavioral economics refers to the field of research which, inspired by numerous documented deviations from 
the rational behavior assumed in neoclassical analysis, tries to improve the psychological realism of the idea 
of man in economics by incorporating insights from psychology into traditional economic analysis. In this cour-
se students will become familiar with several of the most influential behavioral-economic theories of individu-
al decision making, which allows to explain a plethora of empirically documented deviations from the neoclassi-
cal model. These behavioral-economic theories usually contain the neoclassical standard model as special case 
and therefore are to be considered as an extensions of rather than alternatives to the neoclassical model. Whi-
le the focus of this lecture is on theories of individual decision making, we will explore the implications of these 
theories also in the context of market settings.
As behavioral economics represents an extension of the neoclassical model, a solid understanding of the latter 
is required for this course. In consequence, the course is intended in particular for advanced students who com-
pleted the class “Advanced Microeconomics”.

Management
Students gain solid basic knowledge of employment and labour law, the works council and its tasks and an over-
view of collective agreement law. At the same time, methodically and substantively sound legal knowledge is 
conveyed and practical relevance is established with case studies and current case law.
By working on an exam in the form of a legal opinion, the students are taught to solve a demanding legal issue 
with legal problems in a given time. Within a narrow thematic field and a time-limited framework, they are able to 
work on a legal issue in a well-founded and largely independent manner.
Within the framework of the term paper on a judgement of the Federal Labour Court, the students deal with a 
concrete case and the case law of the highest German labour court. They are familiarised with the methods of le-
gal work and are enabled to work independently in a problem-solving manner. In addition to understanding the 
facts of the case and the legal problems, they will focus primarily on the consequences of the judgement for their 
practice. Here, the legal knowledge imparted will be implemented with a practical approach and the opportunity 
to creatively develop their own recommendations on how to deal with the judgement. In addition, the students 
present the case and their own conclusions for practice. In the group discussion, the other students have the op-
portunity to gather further knowledge and actively participate in the exchange of opinions on current judgements 
and case law.
The knowledge imparted is relevant for a wide range of professional fields of activity and is especially valuable 
for students who will work in the field of human resources or are interested in the field of employee manage-
ment.",S (2),,"30 places. (1) Should the number of applications exceed the number of available places, places will be allocated

Master Thesis Business Management,,"Dean of the Faculty of Business Management and Econo-

arch and write on a topic in the area of business management and economics, drawing on the subject-specific 
knowledge they have acquired and adhering to the principles of good scientific practice. This thesis may either 
take the form of an analysis and structured presentation of the existing literature on a certain topic or may, as is 
often the case, also include a presentation of the students' own original achievements, e. g. new algorithms de-
veloped by students or the (further) development of a theoretical model.","In the master thesis students prove that they can plan and carry out a science-based work to solve a particular 
problem within a specified period autonomously and to document the results in accordance with the professio-
nal scientific standards in writing. Students are able to understand relevant contributions to research and pro-
fessional practice, critically analyze and assess the relevance to their own specific questions. They can assess 
and recognize major lines of development and dynamics of the subject and therefore also the need to retrain 
continuously.",No courses assigned to module,,--,,900 h,--,--,,Time to complete: 6 months.
