Contents
With the knowledge of basic programming, taught in introductory lectures, it is possible to realize simpler pro-
grams. If more complex problems are to be tackled, suboptimal results like long, incomprehensible functions 
and code duplicates occur. In this lecture, further knowledge is to be conveyed on how to give programs and co-
de a sensible structure. Also, further topics in the areas of software security and parallel programming are dis-
cussed.
Intended learning outcomes
Students learn advanced programming paradigms especially suited for space applications. Different patterns are 
then implemented in multiple languages and their efficiency measured using standard metrics. In addition, par-
allel processing concepts are introduced culminating in the use of GPU architectures for extremely quick proces-
sing.

Contents
Networks matter! This holds for technical infrastructures like communication or transportation networks, for in-
formation systems and social media in the World Wide Web, but also for various social, economic and biologi-
cal systems. What can we learn from data that capture the interaction topology of such complex systems? What 
is the role of individual nodes and how can we discover significant patterns in the structure of networks? How do 
these structures influence dynamical process like diffusion or the spreading of epidemics? Which are the most 
influential actors in a social network? And how can we analyze time series data on systems with dynamic net-
work topologies?
Addressing those questions, the course combines a series of lectures -- which introduce fundamental concepts 
for the statistical modelling of complex networks -- with weekly exercises that show how we can apply them to 
practical network analysis tasks. Topics covered include foundations of graph theory, centrality and modulari-
ty measures, aggregate statistical characteristics of large networks, random graphs and statistical ensembles 
of complex networks, generating function analysis of expected graph properties, scale-free networks, stocha-
stic dynamics in networks, spectral analysis, as well as the modelling of time-varying networks. The course ma-
terial consists of annotated slides for lectures as well as a accompanying git-Repository of jupyter notebooks, 
which implement and validate the theoretical concepts covered in the lectures. Students can test and deepen 
their knowledge through weekly exercise sheets. The successful completion of the course requires to pass a final 
written exam.
Intended learning outcomes
The course will equip participants with statistical network analysis techniques that are needed for the data-dri-
ven modelling of complex technical, social, and biological systems. Students will understand how we can quan-
titatively model the topology of networked systems and how we can detect and characterize topological pat-
terns. Participants will learn how to use analytical methods to make statements about the expected properties of 
very large networks that are generated based on different stochastic models. They further gain an analytical un-
derstanding of how the structure of networks shapes dynamical processes, how statistical fluctuations in degree 
distributions influence the robustness of systems, and how emergent network features emerge from simple ran-
dom processes.

(Continuous System Engineering), this process of change can be supported effectively and efficiently. This mo-
dule discusses both the systematic implementation of adaptation steps (so-called customising) using the exam-
ple of the mySAP Business Suite and the concept of Continuous System Engineering using various practical ex-
amples. Business Apps: The course combines theory and practice in the area of cloud computing and ERP. Par-
ticipants gain an insight into the architecture of the ByDesign platform and are presented with an opportunity to 
gain practical experience working with the corresponding software development kit.
Content:
• Fundamentals of cloud computing
• Cloud business solutions
• Architecture of the SAP Business ByDesign platform
• Platform adaption and extensibility
• Basics of software development in SAP Cloud Applications Studio
• Hands-on SDK: independently designing and developing a demo app

special requirements of a company. They also develop a fundamental understanding of the dynamic adaptation 
of business software libraries. Based on selected examples from the SAP Business Suite that the acquired know-
ledge will be deepened by using case studies. Business Apps: The course imparts knowledge and delivers skills 
in cloud computing for businesses, ERP systems architecture and software development at the example of the 
SAP Business ByDesign platform. The independent planning, implementation and documentation of a business 
app trains important core competencies of technology-oriented Business Informatics.

Contents
The next generation of business service platforms leads to a transformation of traditional industrial enterprises 
into service businesses that generate a large proportion of value in developed economies. New ICT technologies 
such as cloud computing, the Internet of Things and semantic technologies will contribute to the success of the-
se businesses in a similar way as ERP contributed to the success of industrial enterprises. But we are still at the 
beginning of the evolution of business service platforms, which will have to become more adaptable to support 
special business models and allow differentiating customer service processes.
The course will discuss different case studies on services businesses. The digital transformation of the software 
industry into a service industry is the most prominent of these case.
Intended learning outcomes
Be aware of the growing economic importance of the service sector. Understand that services businesses in are 
facing a special productivity problem, which could not be adressed by the same processes applied in the ma-
nufacturing industries. Understand the new ICT technologies we have at hand today to deliver smart solutions 
for this problem. Be aware of the diversity of services business today where we have no evidence that a general 
standard can be found applicable to most subsectors similar to the standardization achieved for the manufactu-
ring industries after twenty years of research.

ERP systems have become key elements of successful companies. Business processes in companies can no lon-
ger be managed without using such ERP systems. In financial departments of companies, such systems have be-
en used for a long time, but business processes e. g. for logistical tasks have so far not been supported by ERP 
solutions. This module explains how this issue could be resolved as well as what constraints and what depen-
dencies have to be considered.
Intended learning outcomes
After completing this module, students should be able to
(i) know about actual business processes in companies;
(ii) understand selected problems in the organization and design of logistical business processes and work out 
solutions;
(iii) know and design basic data structures and data flows of an ERP system;
(iv) map businesss processes within an ERP system;
(v) consider the specifics of a certain industry (e. g. the process industry) when organizing business processes;
(vi) map the core business processes within an ERP system.

Contents
The idea of integration of business information systems is primarily practiced and developed as an ERP system 
in terms of business application areas, their temporal overlap (data warehouse), their spatial relationship (sup-
ply network) and connection of legal tasks (eGovernment). However, linking the commercial view of incoming cu-
stomer orders with the logistic or more technical view of the scheduling of production orders and the resulting 
consequences for the processes is a critical success factor.
Intended learning outcomes
Linking research and lectures of the Institute of Robotics and Telematics as well as the orientation of the Chair of 
Business Integration allows students a conceptual as well as practical insight into the challenges of this in the 
future essential part of the operational automation development.

Contents
This course provides an introduction into the requirements, concepts, and engineering art of highly interactive 
human-computer systems. Such systems are typically found in perceptual computing, Virtual, Augmented, Mixed 
Reality, computer games, and cyber-physical systems. Lately, these systems are often termed Real-Time Interac-
tive Systems (RIS) due to their common aspects.
The course covers theoretical models derived from the requirements of the application area as well as common 
hands-on and novel solutions necessary to tackle and fulfill these requirements. The first part of the course will 
concentrate on the conceptual principles characterizing real-time interactive systems. Questions answered are: 
What are the main requirements? How do we handle multiple modalities? How do we define the timeliness of 
RIS? Why is it important? What do we have to do to assure timeliness? The second part will introduce a concep-
tual model of the mission-critical aspects of time, latencies, processes, and events necessary to describe a sy-
stem's behavior. The third part introduces the application state, it's requirements of distribution and coherence, 
and the consequences these requirements have on decoupling and software quality aspects in general. The last 
part introduces some potential solutions to data redundancy, distribution, synchronization, and interoperability.
Along the way, typical and prominent state-of-the-art approaches to reoccurring engineering tasks are discussed. 
This includes pipeline systems, scene graphs, application graphs (aka field routing), event systems, entity and 
component models, and others. Novel concepts like actor models and ontologies will be covered as alternative 
solutions. The theoretical and conceptual discussions will be put into a practical context of today's commercial 
and research systems, e.g., X3D, instant reality, Unity3d, Unreal Engine 4, and Simulator X.
Intended learning outcomes
After the course, the students will have a solid understanding of the boundary conditions defined by both, the 
physiological and psychological characteristics of the human users as well as by the architectures and technolo-
gical characteristics of today's computer systems. Participants will gain a solid understanding about what they 
can expect from today's technological solutions. They will be able to choose the appropriate approach and tools 
to solve a given engineering task in this application area and they will have a well-founded basis enabling them 
to develop alternative approaches for future real-time interactive systems.

Contents
The lecture conveys advanced knowledge about methods in computational text processing. To this end, it pres-
ents state of the art models and techniques in the area of machine learning, as well as their technical back-
ground, and their respective applications in Natural Language Processing. As one important building block of 
almost all modern NLP-models, different techniques for learning representations of words, so called Word Em-
beddings, are presented. Starting from this we cover, among others, models from the area of Deep Learning, li-
ke CNNs, RNNs and Sequence-to-Sequence architectures. The theoretical foundations of these models, like their 
training with Backpropagation, are also covered in depth. For all models presented in the lecture, we show their 
application to problems like sentiment analysis, text generation and machine translation in practice.
Intended learning outcomes
The participants have solid knowledge on problems and methods in the area of computational text processing 
and are able to identify and apply suitable methods for a specific task.

Description:
At the beginning of the 21st century, marketing - until then interpreted as a market-oriented corporate manage-
ment approach - was further developed to be seen as the entrepreneurial task of creating "shared value" for the 
organisation on the one hand and - broadly speaking - for society on the other hand. This idea leads to high re-
quirements regarding the strategic sustainable positioning of the brand as well as brand management itself.
Outline of syllabus:
1. Brand leadership and brand assessment
2. Brand leadership, identity and relevance according to David Aaker's approach
3. Brand strategies
4. Consumer behaviour
5. Market research methods and the development of brand strategies
6. Market research methods
Intended learning outcomes
Based on the theories of Meffert and Aaker, students will gain a profound understanding for brand leadership, 
which will be deepened by many pracital implications and examples. Provided by cases studies and market re-
search tools, it's the defined goal of this lecture to convey an in-depth knowledge for consumer behavior and su-
stainable brand management.

Contents
Within the module, theoretical basics of change management are covered. In addition, we present and jointly 
analyze existing change projects in detail. We try to answer related questions, too. For example, the module dis-
cusses how to involve stakeholders in change, what motivates them to embrace change, and whether participa-
tion is a universal principle. The module covers projects like merging two departments, restarting a department 
with team building, conducting an employee survey, or developing a new mission statement. The majority of the 
projects are taken from the social sector, but can be transferred to industry and SMEs.
Intended learning outcomes
After participating the lecture, students will be able to understand the occurrence of resistance and massive 
emotional reactions in change processes. Change processes can be critically analyzed and the use of typical in-
struments in change processes can be questioned. Students are able to identify the typical pitfalls and hurdles 
in these processes and are able to use their knowledge for own future projects as well as to create their own so-
lutions in change processes.

tions. The students will acquire an intuitive understanding of the underlying economic mechanisms which emer-
ge from the analysis of game theoretic models for a wide variety of strategic situations arising in industrial eco-
nomics, marketing, organization, finance, trade and labor. Moreover, they will acquire skills which enable them 
to make predictions in strategic situations by making use of simple mathematical models. By means of comple-
ting case based exercises, they will learn to transform real life business situations to an appropriate economic 
model. Based on an analysis of this model, they will be able to devise optimal strategies and derive the corre-
sponding managerial implications.

Description:
This module deals with the basic concept and methodology of the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression mo-
del. In particular, model assumptions and properties are discussed and formally motivated. In addition, the mo-
dule examines linear restrictions on the model's explanatory variables as well as dummy variables and introdu-
ces tests to verify simple and multiple linear restrictions.
Linear algebra is used as formal aid.
Outline of syllabus:
1. Random variables
2. Important distributions
3. Point estimates
4. Simple linear regression model
5. Model assumptions
6. Model properties
7. Simple hypothesis tests
8. Multiple linear regression model
9. Linear restrictions
10. Dummy variables
11. Multiple hypothesis tests
Intended learning outcomes
The students acquire knowledge of the basics, concepts and methods used in the classical linear regression mo-
del and understand the role of econometrics in science and data analysis. In particular, they learn how to analy-
tically derive, calculate and interpret the coefficients, standard errors and p-values of a classic regression output 
of the multiple regression model. Furthermore, they are able to formally state and motivate the assumptions and 
properties of OLS and know how to deal with transformed and dummy variables. Additionally, students will be 
able to test multiple linear restrictions on the parameters and will be able to apply these tests to real economic, 
business and social science questions.
The competences acquired in this course serve as a prerequisite for "Econometrics II", "Econometrics III", "Micro-
econometrics" und "Financial Econometrics".

Advanced Microeconomics
Module coordinator
Holder of the Chair of Contract Theory and Information Eco-
nomics
ECTS Method of grading
numerical grade
5
Module level
Duration
graduate
1 semester
Contents
In a nutshell, microeconomic theory considers the behavior of individual economic agents and builds from this 
foundation to a theory of aggregate economic outcomes, which then can be applied for conducting welfare ana-
lysis and giving policy advice. This lecture addresses the core building block of this thought complex: individu-
al decision making and behavior. Specifically, students will come to understand in detail the standard models of 
riskless consumer choice, choice under risk and intertemporal choice and learn about the empirical challenges 
and limitations of these models.
Throughout the lecture, we will work with precise mathematical formalizations of the ideas that we want to think 
and talk about. In consequence, a solid understanding of the mathematical toolbox of standard microeconomics 
(e.g., differential calculus and constrained optimization; basic set theory; integration by parts) will be helpful as 
it will allow to focus on the underlying economic intuition. However, every required mathematical concept will be 
introduced and explained along the way, such that a strong interest in formal economic analysis is more import-
ant than an advanced mathematical background.
The exposition is primarily based on the standard graduate textbooks
• Mas-Colell, Whinston and Green (1995): “Microeconomic Theory”
• Jehle and Reny (2001): “Advanced Microeconomic Theory”
Intended learning outcomes
After completing the course students will be able to
• explain essential findings of microeconomic theory,
• apply the involved methods to given stylized examples on their own,
• recognize in which real life situations and how the results can be applied.

Digitalization is rapidly changing our lives, including all types of business relationships. Therefore, new opportu-
nities and approaches have emerged in all areas of the marketing mix: Managers can choose from a wide variety 
of new communication channels, such as social media networks, blogs, or messengers, and can engage in influ-
encer marketing and search engine optimization. They increasingly rely on online customer co-creation or crowd-
sourcing and create a wide variety of new digital products and services, often related to completely new busi-
ness models. Through price crawlers and price setting tools customers‘ price search behaviors have significant-
ly changed, requiring new price setting techniques. Artificial intelligence enables managers to automize and op-

E-commerce is a highly relevant field for almost all types of companies. However, the ecommerce approaches 
and strategies applied by companies differ strongly depending on the respective firm context (e.g., in terms of in-
dustry, types of customers, types of products). In this seminar, students analyze the specific e-commerce strat-
egy of a selected firm. In doing so, they evaluate the strategies’ current and future potential and make suggesti-
ons for improvements and for addressing future trends. Furthermore, each lecture session will contain short pre-
sentations where the students (in groups) will either apply selected lecture topics to real-world business cases 
or present the core aspects of research articles dealing with e-commerce topics in general.
Intended learning outcomes
This class enables students to gain insights into real-life e-commerce strategies and to train their abilities in as-
sessing business strategies.

signments, students are required to connect management theories with the managerial challenges of the spea-
kers.
Managers of the different companies are required to address the following questions that will foster a detailed 
discussion at the end of each lecture:
- What are the current challenges facing your company?
- Which strategies do you employ to respond to these challenges?
- How have leadership concepts and approaches changed in your company?

Contents
The content of the seminar is the active participation in as well as the follow-up of the lectures of economists 
from different national and international fields of activity, which are organized for the event.
The invitation of speakers from practice strengthens the practical orientation of the scientifically founded and at 
the same time internationally oriented education at the faculty of economics of the University of Würzburg.
In this way, students will gain lasting insights into the fields of activity of economists, gain an insight into prac-
tical activities, discuss these with high-ranking economists and combine them with theoretical economic know-
ledge gained during their studies.
Intended learning outcomes
By participating in the seminar, Master's students of the faculty of economics and business administration 
should get to know the different fields of activity of economists and the questions that determine the daily work 
of the speakers in the course of the lectures.
In addition, the participants of the seminar will have the opportunity to apply the knowledge of economics they 
have acquired during their studies. For this purpose, in addition to a discussion with the speakers following the 
respective lecture, a debating workshop is offered to the participants of the seminar, in which the students are to 
learn economic argumentation and debate management. The learned contents and competencies will be tested 
at the end of the semester.

This course offers an introduction to the fundamentals of causal inference and to widely used research desi-
gns in the social sciences. In the first part a framework for understanding causality is introduced. Specifically, 
the epistemological differences between association, intervention and counterfactuals are explained. Then it is 
shown why experiments are paramount in generating causal knowledge and which assumptions are needed for 
which level of the causal hierarchy. Finally, we will discuss two widely used approaches to causality in the social 
sciences, i.e. potential outcomes and directed acyclic graphs.
The second part is devoted to the research designs regressions analysis, difference-in-differences, instrumen-
tal variables, and regression discontinuity. The emphasis is how these research designs are for example applied 
to answer important questions in labour economics such as the effects of a minimum wage increase on employ-
ment or the effect of children on female labour supply and wages.
The assumptions each research design requires in order to identify a causal effect will be at center stage of the 
lecture. Therefore the emphasis is to teach students what one needs to estimate in order to answer a given que-
stion. Further, the research designs are discussed such that students will be able to evaluate and apply these re-
search designs to other questions and fields.
Intended learning outcomes
At the end of the course, students should be able to understand basic concepts and methods of causal infe-
rence, as well as read, interpret, and assess the credibility of scientific publications. In addition, the course ser-
ves as preparation for advanced statistics and econometrics courses.

Contents
Networks matter! This holds for technical infrastructures like communication or transportation networks, for in-
formation systems and social media in the World Wide Web, but also for various social, economic and biologi-
cal systems. What can we learn from data that capture the interaction topology of such complex systems? What 
is the role of individual nodes and how can we discover significant patterns in the structure of networks? How do 
these structures influence dynamical process like diffusion or the spreading of epidemics? Which are the most 
influential actors in a social network? And how can we analyze time series data on systems with dynamic net-
work topologies?
Addressing those questions, the course combines a series of lectures -- which introduce fundamental concepts 
for the statistical modelling of complex networks -- with weekly exercises that show how we can apply them to 
practical network analysis tasks. Topics covered include foundations of graph theory, centrality and modulari-
ty measures, aggregate statistical characteristics of large networks, random graphs and statistical ensembles 
of complex networks, generating function analysis of expected graph properties, scale-free networks, stocha-
stic dynamics in networks, spectral analysis, as well as the modelling of time-varying networks. The course ma-
terial consists of annotated slides for lectures as well as a accompanying git-Repository of jupyter notebooks, 
which implement and validate the theoretical concepts covered in the lectures. Students can test and deepen 
their knowledge through weekly exercise sheets. The successful completion of the course requires to pass a final 
written exam.
Intended learning outcomes
The course will equip participants with statistical network analysis techniques that are needed for the data-dri-
ven modelling of complex technical, social, and biological systems. Students will understand how we can quan-
titatively model the topology of networked systems and how we can detect and characterize topological pat-
terns. Participants will learn how to use analytical methods to make statements about the expected properties of 
very large networks that are generated based on different stochastic models. They further gain an analytical un-
derstanding of how the structure of networks shapes dynamical processes, how statistical fluctuations in degree 
distributions influence the robustness of systems, and how emergent network features emerge from simple ran-
dom processes.

Contents
Students will complete their degree with a Master's thesis in which they will be required to independently rese-
arch and write on a topic in the area of business management and economics, drawing on the subject-specific 
knowledge they have acquired and adhering to the principles of good scientific practice. This thesis may either 
take the form of an analysis and structured presentation of the existing literature on a certain topic or may, as is 
often the case, also include a presentation of the students' own original achievements, e. g. new algorithms de-
veloped by students, surveys, the prototypical demonstration of a concept they developed or the application and 
(further) development of a theoretical model.
Intended learning outcomes
In the master thesis students prove that they can plan and carry out a science-based work to solve a particular 
problem within a specified period autonomously and to document the results in accordance with the professio-
nal scientific standards in writing. Students are able to understand relevant contributions to research and pro-
fessional practice, critically analyze and assess the relevance to their own specific questions. They can assess 
and recognize major lines of development and dynamics of the subject and therefore also the need to retrain 
continuously.
