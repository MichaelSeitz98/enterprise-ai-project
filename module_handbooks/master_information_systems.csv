formation systems and social media in the World Wide Web, but also for various social, economic and biologi-
cal systems. What can we learn from data that capture the interaction topology of such complex systems? What 
is the role of individual nodes and how can we discover significant patterns in the structure of networks? How do 
these structures influence dynamical process like diffusion or the spreading of epidemics? Which are the most 
influential actors in a social network? And how can we analyze time series data on systems with dynamic net-
work topologies?
Addressing those questions, the course combines a series of lectures -- which introduce fundamental concepts 
for the statistical modelling of complex networks -- with weekly exercises that show how we can apply them to 
practical network analysis tasks. Topics covered include foundations of graph theory, centrality and modulari-
ty measures, aggregate statistical characteristics of large networks, random graphs and statistical ensembles 
of complex networks, generating function analysis of expected graph properties, scale-free networks, stocha-
stic dynamics in networks, spectral analysis, as well as the modelling of time-varying networks. The course ma-
terial consists of annotated slides for lectures as well as a accompanying git-Repository of jupyter notebooks, 
which implement and validate the theoretical concepts covered in the lectures. Students can test and deepen

Real-Time Interactive Systems,10-I=LP-172-m01,holder of the Chair of Computer Science IX,Institute of Computer Science,5,numerical grade,,,,,"This course provides an introduction into the requirements, concepts, and engineering art of highly interactive 
human-computer systems. Such systems are typically found in perceptual computing, Virtual, Augmented, Mixed 
Reality, computer games, and cyber-physical systems. Lately, these systems are often termed Real-Time Interac-
tive Systems (RIS) due to their common aspects.
The course covers theoretical models derived from the requirements of the application area as well as common 
hands-on and novel solutions necessary to tackle and fulfill these requirements. The first part of the course will 
concentrate on the conceptual principles characterizing real-time interactive systems. Questions answered are: 
What are the main requirements? How do we handle multiple modalities? How do we define the timeliness of 
RIS? Why is it important? What do we have to do to assure timeliness? The second part will introduce a concep-
tual model of the mission-critical aspects of time, latencies, processes, and events necessary to describe a sy-
stem's behavior. The third part introduces the application state, it's requirements of distribution and coherence, 
and the consequences these requirements have on decoupling and software quality aspects in general. The last 
part introduces some potential solutions to data redundancy, distribution, synchronization, and interoperability.
Along the way, typical and prominent state-of-the-art approaches to reoccurring engineering tasks are discussed. 
This includes pipeline systems, scene graphs, application graphs (aka field routing), event systems, entity and 
component models, and others. Novel concepts like actor models and ontologies will be covered as alternative 
solutions. The theoretical and conceptual discussions will be put into a practical context of today's commercial 
and research systems, e.g., X3D, instant reality, Unity3d, Unreal Engine 4, and Simulator X.","After the course, the students will have a solid understanding of the boundary conditions defined by both, the 
physiological and psychological characteristics of the human users as well as by the architectures and technolo-
gical characteristics of today's computer systems. Participants will gain a solid understanding about what they 
can expect from today's technological solutions. They will be able to choose the appropriate approach and tools 
to solve a given engineering task in this application area and they will have a well-founded basis enabling them 
to develop alternative approaches for future real-time interactive systems.",V (2) + Ü (2),,--,,150 h,--,--,"Master's degree (1 major) Computer Science (2018)

Advanced Microeconomics,12-M-APW1-161-m01,"Holder of the Chair of Contract Theory and Information Eco-

foundation to a theory of aggregate economic outcomes, which then can be applied for conducting welfare ana-
lysis and giving policy advice. This lecture addresses the core building block of this thought complex: individu-
al decision making and behavior. Specifically, students will come to understand in detail the standard models of 
riskless consumer choice, choice under risk and intertemporal choice and learn about the empirical challenges 
and limitations of these models.
Throughout the lecture, we will work with precise mathematical formalizations of the ideas that we want to think 
and talk about. In consequence, a solid understanding of the mathematical toolbox of standard microeconomics 
(e.g., differential calculus and constrained optimization; basic set theory; integration by parts) will be helpful as 
it will allow to focus on the underlying economic intuition. However, every required mathematical concept will be 
introduced and explained along the way, such that a strong interest in formal economic analysis is more import-
ant than an advanced mathematical background.
The exposition is primarily based on the standard graduate textbooks
• Mas-Colell, Whinston and Green (1995): “Microeconomic Theory”
• Jehle and Reny (2001): “Advanced Microeconomic Theory”","After completing the course students will be able to

the epistemological differences between association, intervention and counterfactuals are explained. Then it is 
shown why experiments are paramount in generating causal knowledge and which assumptions are needed for 
which level of the causal hierarchy. Finally, we will discuss two widely used approaches to causality in the social 
sciences, i.e. potential outcomes and directed acyclic graphs.
The second part is devoted to the research designs regressions analysis, difference-in-differences, instrumen-
tal variables, and regression discontinuity. The emphasis is how these research designs are for example applied 
to answer important questions in labour economics such as the effects of a minimum wage increase on employ-
ment or the effect of children on female labour supply and wages.
The assumptions each research design requires in order to identify a causal effect will be at center stage of the 
lecture. Therefore the emphasis is to teach students what one needs to estimate in order to answer a given que-
stion. Further, the research designs are discussed such that students will be able to evaluate and apply these re-
search designs to other questions and fields.","At the end of the course, students should be able to understand basic concepts and methods of causal infe-
rence, as well as read, interpret, and assess the credibility of scientific publications. In addition, the course ser-

Statistical Network Analysis,10-I=OR-232-m01,holder of the Chair of Computer Science XV,Institute of Computer Science,5,numerical grade,,,,,"Networks matter! This holds for technical infrastructures like communication or transportation networks, for in-
formation systems and social media in the World Wide Web, but also for various social, economic and biologi-
cal systems. What can we learn from data that capture the interaction topology of such complex systems? What 
is the role of individual nodes and how can we discover significant patterns in the structure of networks? How do 
these structures influence dynamical process like diffusion or the spreading of epidemics? Which are the most 
influential actors in a social network? And how can we analyze time series data on systems with dynamic net-
work topologies?
Addressing those questions, the course combines a series of lectures -- which introduce fundamental concepts 
for the statistical modelling of complex networks -- with weekly exercises that show how we can apply them to 
practical network analysis tasks. Topics covered include foundations of graph theory, centrality and modulari-
ty measures, aggregate statistical characteristics of large networks, random graphs and statistical ensembles 
of complex networks, generating function analysis of expected graph properties, scale-free networks, stocha-
stic dynamics in networks, spectral analysis, as well as the modelling of time-varying networks. The course ma-
terial consists of annotated slides for lectures as well as a accompanying git-Repository of jupyter notebooks, 
which implement and validate the theoretical concepts covered in the lectures. Students can test and deepen 
their knowledge through weekly exercise sheets. The successful completion of the course requires to pass a final 
written exam.","The course will equip participants with statistical network analysis techniques that are needed for the data-dri-
ven modelling of complex technical, social, and biological systems. Students will understand how we can quan-
titatively model the topology of networked systems and how we can detect and characterize topological pat-
terns. Participants will learn how to use analytical methods to make statements about the expected properties of 
very large networks that are generated based on different stochastic models. They further gain an analytical un-
derstanding of how the structure of networks shapes dynamical processes, how statistical fluctuations in degree 
distributions influence the robustness of systems, and how emergent network features emerge from simple ran-
dom processes.","V (2) + Ü (2)

arch and write on a topic in the area of business management and economics, drawing on the subject-specific 
knowledge they have acquired and adhering to the principles of good scientific practice. This thesis may either 
take the form of an analysis and structured presentation of the existing literature on a certain topic or may, as is 
often the case, also include a presentation of the students' own original achievements, e. g. new algorithms de-
veloped by students, surveys, the prototypical demonstration of a concept they developed or the application and 
(further) development of a theoretical model.","In the master thesis students prove that they can plan and carry out a science-based work to solve a particular 
problem within a specified period autonomously and to document the results in accordance with the professio-
nal scientific standards in writing. Students are able to understand relevant contributions to research and pro-
fessional practice, critically analyze and assess the relevance to their own specific questions. They can assess 
and recognize major lines of development and dynamics of the subject and therefore also the need to retrain 
continuously.",--,,--,,900 h,--,--,,Time to complete: 6 months
