        "## Introduction: TAPAS\n",
        "\n",
        "* Original TAPAS paper (ACL 2020): https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.398/\n",
        "* Follow-up paper on intermediate pre-training (EMMNLP Findings 2020): https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.findings-emnlp.27/\n",
        "* Original Github repository: https://github.com/google-research/tapas\n",
        "* Blog post: https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/04/using-neural-networks-to-find-answers.html\n",
        "\n",
        "TAPAS is an algorithm that (among other tasks) can answer questions about tabular data. It is essentially a BERT model with relative position embeddings and additional token type ids that encode tabular structure, and 2 classification heads on top: one for **cell selection** and one for (optionally) performing an **aggregation** among selected cells (such as summing or counting).\n",
        "\n",
        "Similar to BERT, the base `TapasModel` is pre-trained using the masked language modeling (MLM) objective on a large collection of tables from Wikipedia and associated texts. In addition, the authors further pre-trained the model on an second task (table entailment) to increase the numerical reasoning capabilities of TAPAS (as explained in the follow-up paper), which further improves performance on downstream tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we are going to fine-tune `TapasForQuestionAnswering` on [Sequential Question Answering (SQA)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/search-based-neural-structured-learning-sequential-question-answering/), a dataset built by Microsoft Research which deals with asking questions related to a table in a **conversational set-up**. We are going to do so as in the original paper, by adding a randomly initialized cell selection head on top of the pre-trained base model (note that SQA does not have questions that involve aggregation and hence no aggregation head), and then fine-tuning them altogether.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, we install both the Transformers library as well as the dependency on [`torch-scatter`](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_scatter), which the model requires."
