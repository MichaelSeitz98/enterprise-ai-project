This holds for technical infrastructures like communication or transportation networks, for in-\\nformation systems and social media in the World Wide Web, but also for various social, economic and biologi-\\ncal systems. What can we learn from data that capture the interaction topology of such complex systems? What \\nis the role of individual nodes and how can we discover significant patterns in the structure of networks? How do \\nthese structures influence dynamical process like diffusion or the spreading of epidemics? Which are the most \\ninfluential actors in a social network? And how can we analyze time series data on systems with dynamic net-\\nwork topologies?\\nAddressing those questions, the course combines a series of lectures -- which introduce fundamental concepts \\nfor the statistical modelling of complex networks -- with weekly exercises that show how we can apply them to \\npractical network analysis tasks. Topics covered include foundations of graph theory, centrality and modulari-\\nty measures, aggregate statistical characteristics of large networks, random graphs and statistical ensembles \\nof complex networks, generating function analysis of expected graph properties, scale-free networks, stocha-\\nstic dynamics in networks, spectral analysis, as well as the modelling of time-varying networks. The course ma-\\nterial consists of annotated slides for lectures as well as a accompanying git-Repository of jupyter notebooks, \\nwhich implement and validate the theoretical concepts covered in the lectures. Students can test and deepen \\ntheir knowledge through weekly exercise sheets.

Students will understand how we can quan-\\ntitatively model the topology of networked systems and how we can detect and characterize topological pat-\\nterns. Participants will learn how to use analytical methods to make statements about the expected properties of \\nvery large networks that are generated based on different stochastic models. They further gain an analytical un-\\nderstanding of how the structure of networks shapes dynamical processes, how statistical fluctuations in degree \\ndistributions influence the robustness of systems, and how emergent network features emerge from simple ran-\\ndom processes.\",\"\\n\\nV (2) + Ü (2)\\nModule taught in: English\\n\\n\",\"\\n\\nwritten examination (approx. 60 to 120 minutes).\\nIf announced by the lecturer at the beginning of the course, the written examination may be replaced by an oral \\nexamination of one candidate each (approx. 20 minutes) or an oral examination in groups of 2 candidates (ap-\\nprox. 15 minutes per candidate).\\nLanguage of assessment: German and/or English\\ncreditable for bonus\\n\\n\",\"\\n\\n--\\n\\n\",\"\\n\\nFocuses available for students of the Master\\'s programme Informatik (Computer Science, 120 ECTS credits):\\n\\nIN\\n\\n\",\"\\n\\n150 h\\n\\n\",\"\\n\\n--\\n\\n\",\"\\n\\n--\\n\\n\"\\r\\nOperations Research,10-I=OR-232-m01,Institute of Computer Science,nan,5,numerical grade,1 semester,nan,\"\\n\\n--\\n\\n\",--,\"\\n\\nV (2) + Ü (2)\\nModule taught in: German and/or English\\n\\n\",\"\\n\\nwritten examination (approx. 60 to 120 minutes)\\nIf announced by the lecturer at the beginning of the course, the written examination may be replaced by an oral \\nexamination of one candidate each (approx. 20 minutes) or an oral examination in groups of 2 candidates (ap-\\nprox. 15 minutes per candidate).\\nLanguage of assessment: German and/or English\\ncreditable for bonus\\n\\n\",\"\\n\\n--\\n\\n\",\"\\n\\nFocuses available for students of the Master\\'s programme Informatik (Computer Science, 120 ECTS credits): IN\\n\\n\",\"\\n\\n150 h\\n\\n\",\"\\n\\n--\\n\\n\",\"\\n\\n--\\n\\n\"\\r\\nMachine Learning for Networks 1,10-I=MLN1-232-m01,Institute of Computer Science,nan,5,numerical grade,1 semester,nan,\"\\n\\n--\\n\\n\",--,\"\\n\\nV (2) + Ü (2)\\nModule taught in: English\\n\\n\",\"\\n\\nwritten examination (approx. 60 to 120 minutes)\\nIf announced by the lecturer at the beginning of the course, the written examination may be replaced by an oral \\nexamination of one candidate each (approx. 20 minutes) or an oral examination in groups of 2 candidates (ap-\\nprox. 15 minutes per candidate).\\nLanguage of assessment: English\\ncreditable for bonus\\n\\n\",\"\\n\\n--\\n\\n\",\"\\n\\nFocuses available for students of the Master\\'s programme Informatik (Computer Science, 120 ECTS credits): \\nAT,IT,SE,KI,HCI,IN\\n\\n\",\"\\n\\n150 h\\n\\n\",\"\\n\\n--\\n\\n\",\"\\n\\n--\\n\\n\"\\r\\nData Science,10-I=DM-232-m01,Institute of Computer Science,holder of the Chair of Computer Science IX,5,numerical grade,1 semester,graduate,\"\\n\\nFoundations in the following areas: definition of data mining and knowledge discovery in databases, process \\nmodel, relationship to data warehouse and OLAP data preprocessing, data visualisation, unsupervised learning \\nmethods (cluster- and association methods), supervised learning (e. g.

Such systems are typically found in perceptual computing, Virtual, Augmented, Mixed \\nReality, computer games, and cyber-physical systems.

The first part of the course will \\nconcentrate on the conceptual principles characterizing real-time interactive systems. Questions answered are: \\nWhat are the main requirements? How do we handle multiple modalities? How do we define the timeliness of \\nRIS? Why is it important? What do we have to do to assure timeliness? The second part will introduce a concep-\\ntual model of the mission-critical aspects of time, latencies, processes, and events necessary to describe a sy-\\nstem\\'s behavior. The third part introduces the application state, it\\'s requirements of distribution and coherence, \\nand the consequences these requirements have on decoupling and software quality aspects in general. The last \\npart introduces some potential solutions to data redundancy, distribution, synchronization, and interoperability.\\nAlong the way, typical and prominent state-of-the-art approaches to reoccurring engineering tasks are discussed. \\nThis includes pipeline systems, scene graphs, application graphs (aka field routing), event systems, entity and \\ncomponent models, and others.
