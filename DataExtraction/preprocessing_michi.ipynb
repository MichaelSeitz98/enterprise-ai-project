       "16  Networks matter! This holds for technical infrastructures like communication or transportation networks, for in-\\nformation systems and social media in the World Wide Web, but also for various social, economic and biologi-\\ncal systems. What can we learn from data that capture the interaction topology of such complex systems? What \\nis the role of individual nodes and how can we discover significant patterns in the structure of networks? How do \\nthese structures influence dynamical process like diffusion or the spreading of epidemics? Which are the most \\ninfluential actors in a social network? And how can we analyze time series data on systems with dynamic net-\\nwork topologies?\\nAddressing those questions, the course combines a series of lectures -- which introduce fundamental concepts \\nfor the statistical modelling of complex networks -- with weekly exercises that show how we can apply them to \\npractical network analysis tasks. Topics covered include foundations of graph theory, centrality and modulari-\\nty measures, aggregate statistical characteristics of large networks, random graphs and statistical ensembles \\nof complex networks, generating function analysis of expected graph properties, scale-free networks, stocha-\\nstic dynamics in networks, spectral analysis, as well as the modelling of time-varying networks. The course ma-\\nterial consists of annotated slides for lectures as well as a accompanying git-Repository of jupyter notebooks, \\nwhich implement and validate the theoretical concepts covered in the lectures. Students can test and deepen \\ntheir knowledge through weekly exercise sheets. The successful completion of the course requires to pass a final \\nwritten exam.   \n",

Participants will learn how to use analytical methods to make statements about the expected properties of \\nvery large networks that are generated based on different stochastic models. They further gain an analytical un-\\nderstanding of how the structure of networks shapes dynamical processes, how statistical fluctuations in degree \\ndistributions influence the robustness of systems, and how emergent network features emerge from simple ran-\\ndom processes.  \n",
